#1.    
Write a script named numberlines.py. This script creates a program listing from a source program. This script should 
prompt the user for the names of two files that exist inside of your current github repository for this test. The input 
filename could be the name of the script itself, but be careful to use a different output filename! The script copies 
the lines of text from the input file to the output file, numbering each line as it goes. The line numbers should be 
right-justified in 4 columns, so that the format of a line in the output file looks like this example:

1>  This is the first line of text
2>  This is the second line of text
etc.
etc.
etc.

#2.
Octal numbers have a base of eight and the digits 0â€“7. Write the script to convert numbers between the octal and decimal 
representations of integers. These scripts use algorithms that are similar to those of the binaryToDecimal script developed 
in Section 4-3.

#3.
Write a file that will read all the lines from anotherFile.txt and print the out to the terminal line by line.

#4.
Write a script named dif.py. This script should prompt the user for the names of two text files and compare the 
contents of the two files to see if they are the same (PLEASE use example4a.txt and example4b.txt as your inputs). 
If they are, the script should simply output "Yes". If they are not, the script should output "No", followed by 
the first lines of each file that differ from each other. The input loop should read and compare lines from each 
file. The loop should break as soon as a pair of different lines is found.
