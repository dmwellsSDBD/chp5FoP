Mr. Wells is the coolest teacher in all the world. He is always so very helpful to me, he never makes mistakes, and he is funny.
I would love to someday grow up to be just like Mr. Wells. Maybe I could even learn some musical skills so I can make music like
Mr. Wells. For Christmas I plan to get Mr. Wells a new guitar and the drum set he has always wanted. I also plan on bringing him
Coka-Cola and a bag of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups.
